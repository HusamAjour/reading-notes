## What is Markdown?
Markdown is often used for formatting readme files where the content is more important than the design. Markdown is mostly a regular text with some characters used such as `#` or `*`.

### Headers 
Headers can vary in size. we have six different sizes for headers, and that can be determined by number of # signs you use with the fact that the more # signs you will use the smaller the header you will get.

##### Example:

This is how its written useing markdown:
`# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6`

This is how it appears:
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

**Note:** The order of numbers doesn't really matter as long as the item list is preceded with a number, the markdown will put the numbering as the items are ordered.


### Styling Text
We can style our markdown text as bold, italid, and strikethrough. 

To style the text as bold, we need to put the desired text between `**` `**`.

##### Example:
This is how its written useing markdown:
```
**Bold Text**
```
This is how it appears:
**Bold Text**


We can style our markdown text as bold, Italic, and strikethrough. 

To style the text as Italic, we need to put the desired text between `*` `*`.

##### Example:
This is how its written useing markdown:
```
*Italic Text*
```
This is how it appears:
*Italic Text*


We can style our markdown text as bold, Italic, and strikethrough. 

To style the text as strikethrough, we need to put the desired text between `*` `*`.
