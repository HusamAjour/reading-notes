## Version Control

Version Control records the changes that developers make on their code as versions so they can access it again later instead of keeping all the changes on one last updated files. This feature helps developers to get back to their previos work whenever they need to instead of losing deleting all the new changes that were added and modify the code again. It also allows developers to compare changes betweem versions.

Version control started as a local version control system that each developer has it on his own machine, but the collaboration between developers created the need of a centralized versrion control to make things easier for the team to access the same files and docunments. Since centralized control versioning is vulnerable as a single point of failure, the need to create a distributed version control arised. DVCS allows users to create mirrored repositories as a backup.



## What is GIT

Git is a distributed version control system that saves files as snapshots. Eveytime the user makes a change to his file and commits this change, GIT saves this change as a snapshot and does no change to the original file which means that two different versions of the same file exist at that moment.
