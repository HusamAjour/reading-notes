## How Computers Work

### What makes a computer, a computer?

A computer is one of the tools that humans built to help them in their daily lives. The main reason behind creating comuters was to help in solving mathmatical equations and manipulate information, and the main procedure was to take an input, store the input, process the input, and return the processed input as an output. The main input at the begining was numbers, but with the rapidly evolving life, the input has changed by time to be more than just numbers. Nowadays, and input could be an audio, a video, a reaction, and many other inputs.

### CPU, Mempry, Input & Output

The computer takes input through input devices and they will convert the input into binary information. The memory stores the input information, and the CPU processes this information. And finally, there are output devices that converts the binary information into a physical output.

### Hardware and Software

The computer components are divided into two parts: Hardware and Software. Hardware includes all the physical pieces that you can see and touch, while software includes all the non-phyiscal things that happens inside of the computer.
