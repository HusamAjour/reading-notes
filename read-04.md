## HTML

### Structure

HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language which is used to build and create webpages using elements called tags. Each HTML tag tells the browser something about the information that lays between its openning and closing. HTML tags can be divided into two types: openning tag and closing tag.

The HTML openning tag consists of 3 parts; `<`, `>`, and the value between them, and the HTML closing tag has the same elements in addition to `/` that comes directly after `<`. Also, There are some tags that don't need a closing tag, there are called self-closing tags or void tags.

Example:

`<p></p>`
`<img />`

Another thing that tells us more about the elements is called attrubute. Attributes provide more information about the contents and element. Attributes can be seen in the openning tag of an element, and they require a name and a value.

Example:

`<img src="/image.png">`

### HTML Layout

In HTML 5, the elements started to indicate the purpose of different part of the HTML document and help to organize and describe the structure of the document.

Example:

`<footer></foooter>` This tag is used as the last section of the document which includes the copurights of the website and some useful links. When a user sees this tag, the user would know what it is.

The problem is that some old browsers such as IE8 doesn't support HTML5, and to make it work on that browser you might need to add extra javascript code so the brwoser starts to identify HTML5.

### Process and Design

When you're designing your website, it is really important to build it in a way that attracts your targeted audience, and the website should also have the information that needed by that audience to give them a reason to visit your website.

It is recommended to use site maps when you're building your website, since site maps allows you to plan the structure of the site you want to build. In addition to site maps, Wireframes also help in the same matter. Wireframes allows you to organize the information and on what pages to place them.
